		<h2>About me</h2>
		I'm a Research Engineer at Kwai Inc. Before that, I obtained my M.S from the Computer Science Department at Tsinghua University (2015-2018) and B.E from the Electrical Engineering Department at China Agriculture University (2010-2014).
		<p></p>
 		Currently, I work on model compression and some computer vision problems, such as style transfer and etc. Meanwhile, I'm very interested in convex/non-convex optimization, statistics, and machine learning. 
		<p></p>
		I'm always glad to discuss research.
